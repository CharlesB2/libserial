<area shape="rect" id="node2" href="$classLibSerial_1_1SerialStream.html" title="SerialStream is a stream class for accessing serial ports on POSIX operating systems. A lot of the functionality of this class has been obtained by looking at the code of libserial package by Linas Vepstas, (linas@linas.org) and the excellent document on serial programming by Michael R. Sweet. This document can be found at &lt;ahref=&quot;http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html&quot;&gt; http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html. The libserial package can be found at &lt;ahref=&quot;http://www.linas.org/serial/&quot;&gt; http://www.linas.org/serial/. This class allows one to set various parameters of a serial port and then access it like a simple fstream. (In fact, that is exactly what it does!) It sets the parameters of the serial port by maintaining a file descriptor for the port and uses the basic_fstream functions for the IO. We have not implemented any file locking yet but it will be added soon. " alt="" coords="125,5,280,32"/>
